# 1. Objective

###### Objective
In this tutorial, we offer a step-by-step walk through on how to build a realistic PET simulation in [GATE source page](http://www.opengatecollaboration.org).  

###### Folder Structure
The folder structure where the find the phantom data and GATE macro files can be seen below,
